# Sustainable Floodplain Habitat Finder

This repository contains code used by FlowWest for the Sustainable Floodplain Habitat Finder
web application. The current state of the application is still in the early stages and  under heavy development.

## Todo

Currently due to time constraints the data is hard coded the application, thus the code can be used only for viewing. We will ship a small sqlite database to resulve this problem in the near future.
